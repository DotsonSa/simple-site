# My Simple Site

## It's simple, and it's mine. Currently undecided about the direction of this project.

- [] Background color and color in other places, try to avoid material color choices
- [] figure out how to add javascript ajax thing where the movie list submits to here and makes permanent html changes
- [] create actual content, or fill up page with small projects 
- [] something with ruby because set up personal, local blog in the future with my own coding/experience
