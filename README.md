# My Simple Site

## It's simple, and it's mine. Currently undecided about the direction of this project.

### About headers, footers, and why this is. 

Of what's in it already and what it started from, it's a navigation bar from a site I saw that wasn't well done. The navbar set me off on this project because it was just an image and it's just easier to make it in html/css. The footer then became the orignal image that scales down with broswer size, and underneath is my recreation of it with colors taken from the original. My odd looking personal navbar in the header is what I think a better one is and would be, with colors taken from material design because I wanted to see how it looked there. 

### The weird Moonlight list on the side.

Second project that had no real place, and here's a place that's empty. When I figure out the, probably, simple use of javascript for adding and removing html from the html file, it'll be finished and be used as a list of movies to remember when they're on Netflix months later.

#### Variety list of general ideas to try and attempt
- [] Background color and color in other places, try to avoid material color choices
- [] figure out how to add javascript ajax thing where the movie list submits to here and makes permanent html changes
- [] create actual content, or fill up page with small projects 
- [] something with ruby because set up personal, local blog in the future with my own coding/experience
